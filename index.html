        <p class="sectionTag text-big">What is Education?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, 
            values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed 
            research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. 
            Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, 
            feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.
            Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school 
            and then college, university, or apprenticeship.
            There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards applicable relevance
             in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large or for evidence-based education 
             methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at
              achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes quality education for all. In most regions, education is compulsory
               up to a certain age.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed
             necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed 
             knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that
             could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle 
             Kingdom.[2]
             Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
             Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, 
             established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library
             of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization 
             following the fall of Rome in CE 476.[4]
             In China, Confucius (551â€“479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational
              outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples 
              and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers 
              and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.[5]

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">How Education is Important.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">This is ISCED level 1.[17] Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first four to seven 
            years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the
             age of five to seven, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, in 2008, around 89% of children 
             aged six to twelve were enrolled in primary education, and this proportion was rising.[21] Under the Education For All programs 
             driven by UNESCO, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many 
             countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs 
             at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final 
             stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fifteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly 
             referred to as primary schools or elementary schools.
